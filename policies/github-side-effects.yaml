id: github-side-effects
priority: 20
applies: always
requirements:
  - Do not perform any GitHub operation with side effects unless the user explicitly instructs you to do so.
  - Side effects include (but are not limited to) posting review comments, submitting reviews, creating issues, labeling, closing/reopening, or editing remote content.
  - If the user requests suggested comments/messages, draft them locally but do not submit anything.
  - When drafting GitHub review comments, use English and ensure inline comments can be anchored to diff-resolvable lines; otherwise use a general (non-inline) comment format.
