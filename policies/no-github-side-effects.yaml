    Do not perform any GitHub side effects (posting comments, submitting reviews, creating issues,
    labeling, closing/reopening) unless the user explicitly instructs exactly what to do.
  - >
    If the user asks for comment text, produce it as content only; do not assume it will be posted.
  - >
    Keep the review local and evidence-based: focus on the provided diff and clearly state
